A local copy of the files containing the measured spectral radiances of the four displays used in the experiment in .mat (MATLAB) and .csv (Excel) format. 
Each row contains the spectra of one of the 11 colors tested in the same order as presented in the paper, i.e. row 1 is Color 1 in the paper.

ColorDifferences file contains a 6x11 matrix containing the calculated DEITP
color differences for each of the six pairs of displays (same order as in
the paper) for the 11 tested colors (same order as in paper).
