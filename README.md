# COMFI
A Calibrated Observer Metameric Failure Index for Color Critical Tasks
Supplementary material for the paper "COMFI: A Calibrated Observer Metameric Failure Index for Color
Critical Tasks". Contains the experimental data, its analysis and a minimum code necessary
to calculate COMFI. Each subfolder contains a readme.txt file with more descriptions of
the contents.

Folder contents:
- COMFI - Files needed to calculate COMFI value for a pair of spectra.
- Data_Analysis - Functions used to analyze the data and produce the Figures
in the paper.
- Experiment_Data - Raw experimental data containing observer answers and 
the measured spectra for the displays used in the experiment.
